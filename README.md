# linear_regression_project

This project implements linear regression using both gradient descent and normal equations. The project includes several components to demonstrate the concepts of linear regression and its implementation in Python.

## Project Structure

- **cost_function.py**: Functions to calculate the cost and gradient for linear regression.
- **data_processing.py**: Functions to load and scale the diabetes dataset.
- **gradient_descent.py**: Implementation of the gradient descent algorithm.
- **normal_equations.py**: Implementation of the normal equations method.
- **visualizations.py**: Functions to visualize cost vs iterations and features vs target.
- **main.py**: Main script to run linear regression using different methods.
- **linear_regression_gui.py**: PyQt5-based GUI for running linear regression and visualizing results.
- Compiled `.pyc` files for performance optimization.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib sklearn PyQt5
